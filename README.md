Fake News Detection with Machine Learning - Spring 2022

Completed: 02/07/2022


# Overview
With the surge of fake news plaguing the internet along with my everlasting curiosity. I decided to tackle this project with the goal of understanding how fake news can be exposed through the use of machine learning. In this hands on project, I learned how to train a Bidirectional Neural Network and LSTM based deep learning model to detect fake news from a given news corpus. The process could be done automatically without having humans manually review thousands of news related articles.


# Project Outcomes 
- Create a pipeline to remove stop-words, perform tokenization and padding.
- Train the deep learning model and assess its performance.
- Understand the theory and intuition behind Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTM
